Problem :-
Write A Program To Check Year Is Leap Year Or Not .Means Year Has 366 Days in Year .

Logic :-;
We Know that leap year have 366 Days in a year ,so if year is divide by 4 and 400 then year is leap year or one more condition if year divide by 100 then Year Is Not leap year or Leap Year Comes Every 4 Years Like 
1992 ,1996 ,2000 ,2004 ,2008 ,2012 ,2016 ,2020 These are leap Years.

program:-
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() 
{
    int year;
    cout<<"Enter the year:";
    cin>>year;
    if((year%4)==0 && (year%400)==0)
    {
        cout<<"It is leap year";
    }
    else if(year%100==0)
    {
        cout<<"It is not leap year";
    }
    else
    {
        cout<<"It is leap year";
    }
    return 0;
}

Input:
2004

Output:
Enter the year:2004
It is leap year
